For people looking for shopping deals or lower income families
Who want to reduce their costs, improve their budgeting, or extend their purchasing power
Our grocery app is a software for smartphones that allows users to create profiles in order to store previously catered shopping lists by searching for generic items, and then searching through local grocersâ€™ inventories for the best deals to add to the list
That helps families struggling to afford ever more expensive grocery bills
Unlike Instacart
Our product will be focused on saving money generatively rather than manually searching for items
